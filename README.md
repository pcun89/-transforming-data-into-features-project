# ðŸ§  Feature Engineering: Transforming Data into Features

This project demonstrates key techniques in **feature engineering**, where raw data is transformed into meaningful inputs for machine learning models. It is inspired by Codecademy's **"Transforming Data into Features"** skill path and shows how to preprocess numerical, categorical, and datetime features using Python.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- `feature_engineering.py`: Python script with full transformations
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

A mock dataset is created manually in the script to simulate real-world data. It contains:
- Height and weight (numerical)
- Gender (categorical)
- Signup date (datetime)

```text
| height_cm | weight_kg | gender | signup_date |
|-----------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| 150       | 55        | female | 2020-01-01  |
| 160       | 65        | male   | 2021-06-15  |
| 170       | 75        | female | 2021-07-20  |
| 180       | 85        | male   | 2022-03-10  |
